## About FinSight

### Mission

At FinSight, our mission is to break down barriers and make financial management accessible to everyone, regardless of their visual abilities. We understand the challenges that elderly individuals with visual impairments face when managing their finances, and we're here to bridge that gap.

### Inspiration

The inspiration behind FinSight is to break down barriers and make financial management accessible to everyone, regardless of their visual abilities. We recognized the challenges faced by elderly individuals with visual impairments when it comes to managing their finances. Our mission is to empower them and ensure that they can confidently handle their financial affairs. With over 2.2 billion visually impaired people around the world, FinSight has the potential to change their lives by providing them with the tools they need to achieve financial independence and security.

### Our Vision

We envision a world where financial independence knows no barriers, where everyone can effectively manage their money. FinSight is our commitment to realizing this vision. It's not just an app; it's a catalyst for change.

## How FinSight Works

### Text-to-Speech Magic

Thanks to IBM Watson, FinSight works like magic. It transforms complex financial jargon and data into natural, easy-to-understand speech. Our app reads financial information aloud to users, ensuring they never miss a beat.

### User-Centric Design

Our app's interface is thoughtfully designed with elderly users in mind. Large, clear fonts, high contrast, and an intuitive layout make navigation effortless. We believe in creating an inclusive digital space where everyone feels comfortable.

### Financial Insights

FinSight provides users with valuable insights into their financial health. From real-time account balances to detailed transaction histories, users can stay informed, make informed decisions, and work towards their financial goals.
